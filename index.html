        <h1>World in 2050</h1>
        <p>In 2050, our life will be a lot different from the present day in many aspects like Environment, Education, Communication, health, human life styles, etc. Along with the development of Artificial Intelligence there will be more means of transportation which will use such technology. This will make traveling much easier and faster. Use of energy efficient vehicles will be the new normal. This in turn will bring up more industries and innovation.</p>

<p> Due to the deficiency of petrol and other non-renewable resources, people will depend upon solar power, wind power, Hydro power, etc. for day to day needs.
GDP of various countries will boost up which will improve the world economy. It will in turn lead to inflation as the value of currencies will rise. The outcome of this will improve the standard of living of the business class as they will act as the prime contributors to innovation and development. </p>
        <p>We will also be encountering the problem of rising pollution with the above-mentioned advancements. Be it E-waste or environmental pollution like air and water pollution, it will badly affect our planet making it difficult to survive for the living beings.</p>
        <p> To tackle this problem, scientists are paying more attention by taking appropriate measures which hopefully will reduce pollution to a great extent. 
Also, the technological advancement will make people lazier than the present scenario as there will be robots to help them in many aspects of life.
More companies like SpaceX might come with the motive of reducing transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. </p>
 <p> There will be a lot of change in the next 37 years. It depends on us whether we make our lives better or ruin it. </p>
