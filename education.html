        <h1>Education in 2050</h1>
        <p>Proper and good education is very important for all of us. It facilitates quality learning all through the life among people of any age group, caste, creed, religion and region. It is the process of achieving knowledge, values, skills, beliefs, and moral habits. Education is very necessary for each and everyone in order to improve knowledge, way of living as well as social and economic status throughout the life.</p>

<p> Education in 2050 will be a lot different from today. Needless to say most of the students will be pursuing online education because of the technological development and so the ratio of the staff and student will decrease gradually. Majority of the staff will be administrators, such as marketing, admissions, planning, human resources, finance, legal and It professionals. Most of the academic departments will employ just a handful of people, mainly to develop and maintain online modules and occasionally to deliver face-to-face lectures, seminars and tutorials with a human torch. </p>
<p>The world of Education in 2050 will experience a drastic change. It would be dominated by technological advancement. The way of imparting and receiving education would change a lot. Unlike the traditional system of schooling and learning, students would be learning more from online resources. The role of teachers will diminish in terms of providing education, moreover they will act as facilitators and counsellors. Students would be having a pool of online resources to get themselves educated. 

Merely giving lectures and notes won't work in future. With the development of AI students can get information very easily and at affordable rates. It will be very important to convert information into knowledge because the internet is full of information but whether the information is useful or not that needs to be considered and here teachers will play a vital role. Teachers must impart knowledge and wisdom to the students which would make them a successful individual. </p>
        <p>The majority of staff, however, will be robots with super intelligence. Teacher robots will prepare courses, give lectures, answer questions, set and mark assignments, and provide timely and insightful feedback.</p>
