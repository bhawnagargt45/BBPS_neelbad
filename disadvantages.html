        <ol start="1" type="1">
       		 <li>There will be mechanical teachers in future, therefore the students will get the limited knowledge about the topics.</li><br>
             <li>Future schools will have the digital gadgets for studies that may cause harm to the eyes and students will be always seen stuck to the tablets and laptops.</li><br>
             <li>E-learning might cause social isolation. E-learning requires strong self-motivation and time management skills. There might be lack of communicational skill development among online students. Cheating prevention during online assessments might get complicated.</li><br>
             <li>Online learning may create a sense of isolation as everyone learns in their own manner.  Some students possess the ability to work independently, while others find comfort  with  professors or their fellow students.</li><br>
             <li>Many teachers will be unemployed because robots will be teaching instead of humans.</li><br>
             <li>Students might end up taking wrong decisions as the internet can many times be misleading. So absence of human teachers might make a child emotionally unstable.</li><br>
             <li>Increased competition may create unnecessary stress among students surrounded by technology where the child might not be able to perform efficiently.</li><br>
